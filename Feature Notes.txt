Infos on use case:
- Page is intended for administrators only
- Page is not used that often --> clearness of functionality is important
- Not likely that it will be expanded massively in the future, so the current view should work reasonably well
- In case options double or triple in volume: restructuring necessary

Thoughts on Role Settings Page:
- Add Collapse All and Expand All buttons on bottom
- Description needs to be added to the data model --> Figure out proper way to integrate into view

Additional Features:
- Select All and Unselect All buttons at the bottom // how useful is this? Too narrow in application (only usable for admin definition)
- For each Topic: Select All Of This and Unselect All Of This buttons (maybe too crowded? usefulness?)
- Preset role profiles? (probably not the best since it's not used often, and proper access rights are more important than quick assignment of rights)
- Customize role profile and save as custom role (good feature, but not appropriate for the current use case)
